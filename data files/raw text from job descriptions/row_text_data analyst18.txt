Note : Kindly do not apply for C2C as it is the w2 requirement. We are able to sponsor H1 so if you are looking for the transfer you can apply for this role.
MUST HAVE: This is more of a Data Analyst with SQL/ETL/Requirement Gathering. Update from the manager:
Core systems analysis work – I am a little wary of business analysts since the work they do is completely different.
They should have done requirement gathering and documented that
Looking for ETL/data based exposure
Looking for them having come up with mapping documents that kind of depicts the data flow where applicable
SQL is really needed
Worked directly with the business users / tech teams / QAs etc.
DO NOT need someone who has created dashboards etc. – doesn’t really help much in our line of work

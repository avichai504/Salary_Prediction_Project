Research question:
Can we predict the level of employee satisfaction in the tech industry based on job title, location, salary estimate, company rating,
company size, company founded, industry, and sector using machine learning techniques?

Background/motivation:
The motivation for this project is to *identify the factors that contribute to employee satisfaction in the tech industry
and to determine which jobs in the industry are the most rewarding for employees.*
This information can be used by job seekers to make informed decisions about their career paths,
and by employers to improve their workplace culture and retain talented employees.

Features:
The dataset contains information on the job title, location, salary estimate, company rating, work-life balance rating,
company size, company founded, industry, sector and option to work from home; for each job in the tech industry.
The dataset may also include additional features that are relevant to employee satisfaction, such as work-life balance,
job security, career growth opportunities, company culture, health insurance, work from home, vacation & paid time off.
I will get this additional data as soon as my research question will be approve :)

Instances:
The dataset includes approximately 100,000 jobs in the tech industry, with each row representing a single job posting.

Data sources:
The data was scraped from the Glassdoor website, which provides detailed information on job listings and company profiles.
This gives us an edge over publicly available sources, as Glassdoor provides more detailed information on job satisfaction
and company culture.

Data mining methods:
I used web scraping techniques to extract data from the Glassdoor website.
I used Python Selenium liberty to automate the data collection process.
I scraped multiple pages of job listings to gather a large dataset.

Planned visualizations:
I plan to use scatter plots and heat maps to explore the relationships between the different features
and the level of employee satisfaction.
I also plan to use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA)
to visualize the dataset in lower dimensions.

Planned models:
I plan to use various regression models such as linear regression,
decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to predict the level of employee satisfaction based on the given features.

Validation methods:
I plan to use k-fold cross-validation and hold-out validation to evaluate the performance of our models.
I will use metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared to measure the performance of our models.

Role: QA Engineer with AEM Experience
Length: 6 months to start, with strong possibility of extension, long-term role
Location: 100% Remote, must work West Coast hours
Skills:
 AEM experience
 Two week Sprint, fast moving, need to be able to adapt to that
 Almost entirely Manual, very little Automation, big plus if has experience validating automation logs
 End to end testing or System Integration Testing, front end website (UI Testing), verify data on backend
 No programming languages needed
 Backend: AWS and Salesforce, verify data (Community and Marketing Cloud), AWS and Salesforce - a plus, not necessary
 Experience with validating data in backend, Salesforce is a definite plus
 Database experience, MySQL, Athena (service from AWS, Cloud database tool, query against it)
 API Testing as well, not extensively, wants to include that
 Adobe Experience Manager is a big plus (would prioritize Candidates with AEM experience)
Reliable: assigning work, good comm skills, willing to speak up in meetings (multiple Scrum meetings every two weeks, daily calls, speak up and share perspective)
Willing to help others on Team
